* Forward is a sort of Forth-in-Lisp.

It plans to bring Forth syntax and semantics in a Lisp environment.

In order to:
- Make it easier to have an interactive prompt to interact with
  sotfware.
- Make it easier to control and limit the possible interaction with
  said software.

Forward wants to be only a base on which the control words for each
application is layered on top of.

* Data structure
** *stack*
   Should not be a global variable but a local variable that is passed
   around.
** *dictionary*
   See supra.
** Word
   Each word is a symbol with added information on its plist.
   - name
     The symbol-name of the word
   - core
     Boolean pointing if it's a base-word. Basically is its function
     `eval'd or `run'
   - code
     If core: a lisp expression run in a lambda.
     If not core: a list of words.
   - here
     The index of the word in the dictionary, unused as of now.
